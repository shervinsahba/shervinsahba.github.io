Hey. This will be my new page.

[Here's my CV.](/about/CV-20191115.pdf "Click!")


### About me

I'm a Physics PhD Student at the University of Washington. My research interests center on machine learning, photonics, and applied mathematics. 

Prior to academia, I worked as a private tutor and test prep instructor, event and logistics manager, marketing data analyst, and psychology research assistant.

I'm a fan of guitar, writing, chess, rock climbing, hiking, lifting, bicycles, art, and game design.

<!-- ### About this page
I made this site on <a href="https://www.github.io">Github Pages</a> using the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> static site engine. The theme I adapted from <a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/brume">Brume</a> theme. Github Pages provides free storage, Jekyll is FOSS, and the Brume theme is similarly free under a Creative Commons license.

Vector icons, like the <i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i> symbol on the home page are implemented using <a href="https://fontawesome.com/?from=io">Font Awesome</a> and <a href="https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/">Academicons</a>. Code highlighting, such as that seen in this [post](/email-obfuscation), is via <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> CSS and Javascript. Again, all free to use.

Pretty sweet. -->
