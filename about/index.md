Yo! This will be my new page. It will be filled with things I want to tell you about :)

### About me

I'm a Physics PhD Student at the University of Washington. My research interests center on machine learning, photonics, and applied mathematics. 

Prior to academia, I worked as a private tutor and test prep instructor, event and logistics manager, marketing data analyst, and psychology research assistant.

I'm a fan of guitar, writing, chess, rock climbing, hiking, lifting, travel, spontaneous forays into art, and game design.
