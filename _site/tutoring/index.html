  <h2>Tutoring</h2>

  <p>I love to learn and love to teach! Below I’ve detailed my experience and subjects. At this time I am only taking students local to Seattle. Please be in touch with any inquiries. Thank you!</p>

<h3 id="experience">Experience</h3>

<p>I began instructing in 2010 with Revolution Prep as a SAT and ACT classroom instructor, eventually reaching over a thousand students at multiple high schools and centers in the SF Bay Area. I received accolades as a strong and understanding instructor when I worked at Revolution Prep and then later at the Elite Education Institute. Now at the University of Washington, I teach all levels of physics. My performance earned me a First Year Teaching Award. I also volunteer as a <a href="https://carpentries.org/">Software Carpentries</a> instructor.</p>

<p>More detailed background is available on my resume and on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ssahba/">my LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<h3 id="subjects">Subjects</h3>

<p>I specialize in applied math and physics, as well as instructing comprehensive test prep. Below is a list of topics where I have teaching experience. Reach out if there’s something not on the list, so I can make a recommendation. Thanks!</p>

<!-- <a href="./scores.html">My Test Prep Scores</a> -->

<p>My most recent experience with standardized testing was in preparation for PhD program applications. I prepped for the GRE and the GRE Physics Subject Test using the skills I learned as a tutor. Here were my results.</p>
