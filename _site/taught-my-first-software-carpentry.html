  <h2>Taught my first Software Carpentry workshop.</h2>

  <blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Carpentries is a volunteer-run organization that teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Earlier this month, I instructed my first <a href="https://uwescience.github.io/2019-07-15-uw/">Software Carpentry workshop</a>! This was both the first time Iâ€™ve live-coded and the first time I taught a room full of individuals who were further along in their careers than myself. The crowd was a mix of well-established professors, staff scientists, and graduate students.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I prepared my UNIX and Shell scripting lesson twice-over! We somehow managed to press through the bulk of the 4.5 hours of material in the 3h we were allotted, and the number of thank-yous I received afterwards from established post-docs and scientists was humbling.</p>

<p>If you enjoy making connections, teaching, and working with the tools of modern data science, I encourage you to check out <a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a>.</p>
