<h4 id="i-grew-up-making-games">I grew up making games.</h4>

<p>I grew up enamored with video games. Naturally, as a youth, I ventured to make my own. This started by drawing pen and paper levels in elementary school to dabbling in old-school simplified game engines such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq997czKsx0">Click ‘n Create</a> and archaic versions of the still-alive <a href="https://www.rpgmakerweb.com">RPG Maker</a> as a teen. My success was mostly limited to distributing a handful of 3.5” floppies to curious friends, but it was amazing fun. Anyway, I decided that game design is worth a revisit. On Sunday, I spent the morning working through a tutorial project in <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>, an open-source game engine designed at MIT.</p>

<h4 id="why-godot">Why Godot?</h4>

<p>I recommend Godot as a piece of software. It’s rising in popularity, works for both 2D and 3D game design, and is <em>completely free</em> to use even for commercial purposes. Well-known contenders such as Unity are appealing too, but I’m enjoying the accessibility of Godot’s native and pythonic GDScript script, the ability to also use C# scripting, and it’s multi-OS compatability including Linux support.</p>

<h4 id="dodge-the-creeps">Dodge the Creeps!</h4>

<p>The game I worked on is a tutorial called <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html">Dodge the Creeps!</a> It’s a classic, top-down dodge the bad guys game. The assets and design are all from the tutorial, but I ported the game to Android and mapped the controls to the phone’s accelorometer. In my version, you play it by holding your phone level and tilting the screen to move.</p>

<p>You can play it by downloading the <a href="https://github.com/shervinsahba/godot/tree/master/Dodge/export/Android">Dodge.apk</a> file off my GitHub onto your Android device and running the app.</p>
